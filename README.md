An R package containing miscellaneous functions that I use all the time.

This is my first attempt to create an R package after many shameful years spent cutting and pasting. This is still a work in progress since I'm still a beginner at creating R packages, but it's not as difficult as I thought it would be. 

##References
I was inspired to try this out after reading a post on [Hilary Parker's blog](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/). Two other valuable resources for R package creation are Hadley Wickham's [Advanced R Programming]("http://adv-r.had.co.nz/") and the documentation for [roxygen2]("https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen#roxygen2"). One of these days I'm going to get around to reading the definitive documentation contained in [Writing R Extensions]("http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Creating-R-packages").

##Workflow
The basic workflow for updating this package is as follows. If they're not installed already, install the packages `devtools` and `roxygen2`
